# DISCLAIMER

This is a Final Year Project done by Pavithiran Nair Chandran. 

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

People are advised to stay safe in this pandemic season and avoid crowded areas, especially when buying necessary things at grocery mart or supermarket. 
Many were trying their best to obey the social distancing rules, but unfortunately, they fail when they stand in a long queue to pay for the items.  

Besides that, the customers also often lose their financial tracking when shopping at the market. 
This also would result in a long queue when the particular customer has trouble settling the amount at the counter. 
On the other half, the cashiers also have difficulties managing the transaction while obeying the social distancing.  

# OBJECTIVES

```text
#1
To create a platform where customers can add their preferred products into the cart by scanning the barcodes through their mobile phones. 

#2
To Create a mobile app system where cashiers can directly scan into customers payment QR code to verify their payment without having to scan each item codes. 

#3
Create a mobile application for cashier to record their sales and information in the database through the application.
